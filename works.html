                    <h2>Browso</h2>
                    <p>Working for a company that specializes in customer service software, you come to recognize the
                        digital eco-system that exists around it. Is a customer having an issue with your site? Help
                        them troubleshoot by getting their device details. Browsing through these troubleshooting tools,
                        however, it seemed like most were created out of necessity. They had a purely functional
                        approach to the problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>Browso is my take on that experience. Why does it need to be boring?
                        There's plenty of room for
                        fun
                        and personality. Browso presents your device details is a slightly different way... a time warp
                        to
                        earlier this century. All designed to make life a little easier for customer service
                        professionals.
                        Most importantly, it's a fun distraction during our hectic days. Let me know if you're able to
                        beat
                        Browso Ball.

                    <p>Talk to your teammates directly inside a Figma frame. There’s no third-party servers or setup
                        required, simply select the frame you want to comment on and chat away.

                    <p> Figchat renders all your
                        comments as items within Figma itself.

                    <p>Figma already has a commenting system, but Figchat was
                        created for those situtations where you need

                    <h2>Jeffsum</h2>
                    <p>Jeff Goldblum photos had started making their way into our shared design files, in lieu of some
                        actual content. Pure placeholder stuff. They tell designers never to do these kinds of things,
                        but
                        hey, the real world happens. To continue the joke, I figured we needed some Goldblum quotes to
                        go
                        with it. To my amazement, no quote generator existed for Jeff. I was as shocked as you are now.
                        Clearly, there was only one alternative, make one myself. And so Jeffsum was born. All your
                        favourite quotes in one handy place.
